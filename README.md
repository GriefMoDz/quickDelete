# Quickdelete

Powercord implementation of the [QuickDeleteMessages](https://github.com/Inve1951/BetterDiscordStuff/blob/master/plugins/QuickDeleteMessages.plugin.js) plugin by [Square](https://github.com/Inve1951). The code itself is strongly based on the ClickableEdits plugin by [Harley](https://github.com/GriefMoDz). 

## What does it do?

Allows you to hold the CTRL key and click on any message to remove it.

## How to use it?

1. Clone the repo into the plugins folder of Powercord using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/GhostlyDot/quickDelete.git
```

2. a. Reload Discord
    b. Put the following command into the Discord dev console:

```
